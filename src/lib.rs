//! An ergonomic input API for the playdate
//!
//! The traits [`ButtonsStateSource`] and [`CrankStateSource`] describe the available API.

//! * `playdate-sys-v02`: provides implementations of the input source traits for the type `ffi::playdate_sys` and `ffi::PlaydateAPI` of the crate [`playdate-sys`](https://docs.rs/playdate-sys/0.2) (version `0.2`)
